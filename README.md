# PUSH

For the syntax and some examples, go to https://esolangs.org/wiki/PUSH.

# Usage:

* Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/expliked/PUSH.git` or by just downloading the `.zip` file.
* Compile `push.cpp` using `g++ -i push.cpp -o push.exe`.
* You need to include a file with PUSH code inside it, and provide that file when running the executable.
* Please create an issue if you do find one.
* Enjoy this little project of mine! :)
